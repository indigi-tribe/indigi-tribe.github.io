Someone has let these kiwiPunks out into the interwebs. they're a bloody nuisance, loitering all day. worse than the weka. can pry find a couple over at [hic et nunc (tezos)](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/i.t.21). 

a series of 50 ai generated kiwiPunks can be found over on [solsea.io (solana)](https://solsea.io/collection/61864981cdef9384eb9c0a50). i am currently releasing and listing 5 per day. just search for the ```kiwiPunk``` collection. it is currently an unverified collection. we just applied for verification and should change to a verified collection soon.
